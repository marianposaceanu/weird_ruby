# Ruby & the LISP Alien Tech: A Code Adventure

This repository contains the source code and resources for my presentation "Ruby & the LISP Alien Tech: A Code Adventure" at the [Friendly.rb](https://friendlyrb.com) conference. The presentation explores the intriguing blend of Ruby with LISP, particularly through the lens of Clojure, and demonstrates an experimental integration of Ruby on Rails with Clojure.

## What's Inside?

- `Source Code`: Dive into the code where Ruby meets Clojure. See how I used JRuby to render HTML with Clojure's Hiccup library in a Rails application.
